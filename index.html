      We Bear Bears is a mobile video game surronding 3 bear brother, Griz, Pan
      Pan and ice bear. The game is sort of like candy crush but with way more
      obsticals, my friend got me to start playing it (now I'm addicted even
      though she stopped playing it).

      popular. My Favorite songs by him are:
